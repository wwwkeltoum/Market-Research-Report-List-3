<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Auto Oil Lube System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct System</li><li>Indirect System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Auto Oil Lube System market can be classified into two main types: Direct System and Indirect System. In Direct System, the oil flows directly from the oil pump to the engine components requiring lubrication. This system is more efficient and provides better lubrication. In Indirect System, the oil is circulated through a series of passages before reaching the engine components. This system is simpler and less expensive but may not offer as precise lubrication as the Direct System. Both systems have their advantages and are used in different types of vehicles based on requirements.</p></p>
