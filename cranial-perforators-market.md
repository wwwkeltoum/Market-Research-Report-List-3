<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cranial Perforators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thin Bone Area</li><li>Thick Bone Area</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cranial perforators are medical devices used in neurosurgery to create precise holes in the skull to access the brain. These devices are designed for different types of bone thickness, such as thin bone areas and thick bone areas. Thin bone area perforators are smaller and more delicate, suitable for areas with less bone density. In contrast, thick bone area perforators are larger and more robust, suitable for areas with thicker bone structure. Both types of perforators play a crucial role in enabling surgeons to perform safe and effective brain surgeries.</p></p>
