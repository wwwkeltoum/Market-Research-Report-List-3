<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sacral Nerve Stimulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rechargeable spinal-cord stimulator</li><li>Non-chargeable spinal-cord stimulator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sacral nerve stimulators are divided into two main market types: rechargeable spinal-cord stimulators and non-chargeable spinal-cord stimulators. Rechargeable spinal-cord stimulators are devices that can be charged multiple times, providing longer-lasting stimulation for patients. Non-chargeable spinal-cord stimulators, on the other hand, are designed for one-time use and may need to be replaced once their battery is depleted. Both types of stimulators are used to help manage chronic pain conditions by delivering electrical stimulation to the sacral nerves.</p></p>
