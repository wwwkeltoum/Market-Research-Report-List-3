<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pacemaker</li><li>ICD</li><li>CRT</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) Devices are specialized medical devices used to treat heart failure. These devices come in three main types - Pacemakers, Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs), and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillators (CRT-Ds). Pacemakers regulate the heart's electrical rhythms, ICDs deliver electric shocks to correct dangerous heart rhythms, and CRT-Ds combine both functions to improve heart function and reduce symptoms of heart failure. These devices are crucial in managing heart failure and improving patients' quality of life.</p></p>
