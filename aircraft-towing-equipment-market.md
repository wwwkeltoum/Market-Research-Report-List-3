<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Towing Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Towbar Tractors</li><li>Towbarless Tractors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft towing equipment market consists of two main types: towbar tractors and towbarless tractors. Towbar tractors use a towbar attached to the nose landing gear of the aircraft for towing, providing a more stable and controlled towing operation. On the other hand, towbarless tractors eliminate the need for a towbar by lifting the aircraft's nose landing gear directly, offering more flexibility and maneuverability. Both types of equipment are essential for safely moving aircraft on the ground.</p></p>
