<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Influenza NA Inhibitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Zanamivir</li><li>Oseltamivir</li><li>Peramivir</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Influenza NA inhibitors are antiviral drugs used to treat influenza infections. The three main types are Zanamivir, Oseltamivir, and Peramivir. Zanamivir is typically inhaled and works by blocking the action of the neuraminidase enzyme on the surface of the influenza virus. Oseltamivir is taken orally and also inhibits the neuraminidase enzyme. Peramivir is administered intravenously and works by binding to the neuraminidase enzyme. These drugs help to reduce the severity and duration of influenza symptoms.</p></p>
