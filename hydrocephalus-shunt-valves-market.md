<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrocephalus Shunt Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adjustable Pressure</li><li>Monopressure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydrocephalus shunt valves are devices used to treat hydrocephalus by diverting excess cerebrospinal fluid from the brain. There are two main types: adjustable pressure valves and monopressure valves. Adjustable pressure valves allow for manual adjustments of the valve settings to optimize fluid drainage. Monopressure valves, on the other hand, have a fixed pressure setting. Both types play a crucial role in managing hydrocephalus and ensuring proper fluid drainage to relieve symptoms and prevent complications.</p></p>
