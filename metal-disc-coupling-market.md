<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Disc Coupling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Disc Couplings</li><li>Double Disc Couplings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Metal disc couplings are a type of flexible coupling used to connect two shafts in order to transmit torque while allowing for misalignment. There are two main types of metal disc couplings based on the number of discs used: single disc couplings and double disc couplings. Single disc couplings consist of one disc whereas double disc couplings have two discs. Single disc couplings are more compact and can accommodate lower torque loads, while double disc couplings are able to handle higher torque levels and provide better flexibility.</p></p>
