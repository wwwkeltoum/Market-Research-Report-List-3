<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Booster Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-cooled</li><li>Water-cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Booster compressors can be categorized into two types based on their cooling methods: air-cooled and water-cooled. Air-cooled compressors rely on the surrounding air to dissipate heat generated during compression, making them suitable for applications where water availability is limited. On the other hand, water-cooled compressors use water to remove heat, allowing for higher efficiency and better performance in high-temperature environments. Both types offer unique advantages and are chosen based on specific cooling requirements and operating conditions.</p></p>
