<p><strong>The Retinal Detachment Diagnostic Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment</li><li>Exudative Retinal Detachment</li><li>Tractional Retinal Detachment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The retinal detachment diagnostic market is used for diagnosing three main types of retinal detachment: rhegmatogenous, exudative, and tractional. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment occurs when a tear or hole in the retina allows fluid to accumulate behind it. Exudative retinal detachment is caused by fluid leaking into the retina from blood vessels or other areas of the eye. Tractional retinal detachment occurs when scar tissue or other growths on the retina pull it away from the underlying layers.</p></p>
