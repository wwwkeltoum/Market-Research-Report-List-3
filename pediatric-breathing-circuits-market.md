<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pediatric Breathing Circuits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-open Type</li><li>Close Type</li><li>Open Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pediatric breathing circuits are essential components of medical equipment used in pediatric anesthesia. Three main types of pediatric breathing circuits are commonly used: semi-open type, close type, and open type. Semi-open type circuits have a reservoir bag that allows a small amount of rebreathing. Close type circuits do not have a reservoir bag and provide fresh gas for each breath. Open type circuits have no rebreathing and are mainly used for short procedures. Each type has its own advantages and is used based on the specific needs of the patient and procedure.</p></p>
