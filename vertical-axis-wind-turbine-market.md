<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vertical Axis Wind Turbine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Darrieus</li><li>Savonius</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vertical Axis Wind Turbines come in two main types: Darrieus and Savonius. Darrieus turbines have curved blades that are attached to a central shaft, allowing them to capture wind from any direction. Savonius turbines, on the other hand, have a simple design with curved blades that rotate due to the drag force of the wind. Both types have their own advantages and disadvantages, with Darrieus turbines being more efficient at higher wind speeds and Savonius turbines being more suitable for low wind speed conditions.</p></p>
