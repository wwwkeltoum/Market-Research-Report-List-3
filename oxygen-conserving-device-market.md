<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oxygen Conserving Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pneumatic</li><li>Electronic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oxygen conserving devices are used to regulate the flow of oxygen to patients who require supplemental oxygen therapy. There are two main types of devices on the market: pneumatic and electronic. Pneumatic conserving devices operate using a simple valve system to deliver oxygen based on the patient's inhalation patterns. On the other hand, electronic conserving devices use sensors and microprocessors to monitor and deliver oxygen flow. Both types of devices help to reduce wastage of oxygen and make oxygen therapy more efficient for patients.</p></p>
