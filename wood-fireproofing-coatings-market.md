<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wood Fireproofing Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-based</li><li>Solvent-based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wood fireproofing coatings come in two main types: water-based and solvent-based. Water-based coatings are environmentally friendly, easy to clean up, and have low volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. They are suitable for indoor applications where odor and toxicity concerns are important. Solvent-based coatings, on the other hand, offer better adhesion and are more durable than water-based coatings. However, they typically have higher VOC emissions and may require special precautions during application and cleanup. Both types of coatings are effective in protecting wood from fire damage.</p></p>
