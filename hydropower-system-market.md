<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydropower System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Impulse Turbines</li><li>Reaction Turbines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydropower system market can be divided into two main types: impulse turbines and reaction turbines. Impulse turbines operate by converting the kinetic energy of flowing water into mechanical energy through the impact of water on turbine blades. In contrast, reaction turbines work by harnessing the energy of water pressure as it flows through the turbine. Both types play a crucial role in generating hydropower by utilizing the natural force of water to produce electricity efficiently and sustainably.</p></p>
